## The Project

The project was done as part of the Grace Hopper Stackathon. The goal was to have a completed project within about four and a half days. The prompt was to build something cool and learn something new. I chose to learn React Native, since I found a lot of success with React/Redux in the web browswer. Although there are heavy similarities between the two, I definitely found there was a learning curve with React Native - and I never expected to miss CSS so much! 

# Things I Loved About This Project 
*Learning how to use React Native and build a mobile app! So cool!  
*I hadn't pulled information from an API before, and now I have access to so much new information.  
*Learning cool space facts. Not necessarily relevant to coding, but still neat. Did you know that it's raining sulfer on Venus almost 100% of the time?  
*I learned the basics of React Hooks, which I can't wait to implement in future projects! I didn't use them everywhere, but in the future I will potentially refactor to do so.  
 

# Future Features and Updates
*I'd like to put the soundscape controls in a drawer. I wasn't able to figure out how to implement that this time around. You also cannot go back and pause tracks once you leave the page - I'd love to figure out how to make that persist.  
*The ISS widget should use reverse geolocation to show which city the ISS is flying over.  
*There's a small bug with the navigation; I'd like to get a better grasp on React Native Navigation and it's many, many nuances.  
*The Soundscapes code is the least DRY code ever written! I opted to get functionality and then refactor afterwards, since getting the audio player to work had been a frustrating journey, but then I ran out of time to refactor. But...at least it works!  
*Better styling and element management  


## Notes

*I take full credit/blame for the terrible graphic design. It's not a graphic design bootcamp! :)  That may also be a future feature/update!  
*AstraTempest very loosely translates to Space Weather, if you're willing to trust some Google Translate.  
*All API information and sounds are sourced from NASA.
