1. consider killing your darlings and getting rid of the home page buttons. (SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE THEM WORK FIRST THO.)
2. if so, make a cool "where is the ISS" widget
3. also consider moving soundscapes to home page
4. figure out how to make soundscapes loop
5. add more sounds? 

6. Add descriptions to each page - what each event is etc.
