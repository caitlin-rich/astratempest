OKAY 

here's what we need to do sunday: 

1. make the Where Is The ISS widget
2. get soundscapes to loop & add more sounds
3. try and fix home page links vs nav drawer links issue
4. consider killing your darlings and getting rid of the home page buttons. (SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE THEM WORK FIRST THO.)
 

6. Add descriptions to each page - what each event is etc.
